Starting with my main html file under my first header I give it the title of favourite music and link it to my CSS stylsheet.
Next under my body comes my navigation bar where I enter my sections that will go in the main content and assign classes to in order to later on style it.
Under the article tag which is where all of my sctions will go I first have a welcome message as my main title and then a series of calsses and id related 
divs that will later allow me to style certain sections separately such as the container and card. In these containers and cards come a series of images, paragraphs, 
audio files, and youtube videos that will serve as the main content form my website. Lastly in my html file I add a basic footer with contact information pertaining to me 
in case the user wants additional information.

In my CSS file I firstly use a set of CSS variables that set global styles that I will later call to style elements. 
I then use the @font-face tag and import a custom google font that changes font style for the entire website.
I set the margin and paddings for my body. After that I style my navigation menu by setting the position, sizes and calling my variables to colour it.
I then position and style the cards and card containers that will give a cohesive look to my entire website through the main content.
I use the @media element to ensure my website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Img elements were all sized equally to create a visually appealing and minimal design. Then I style where the position of my actual text within my cards will go in relation to the videos, images, and audio files
as well as clouring my text and links to fit the theme. Lastly I style my footer, once again calling my CSS variables to keep a consitent colour theme in my website as well as using text align, padding, and margin
to position my footer and the text inside my footer.
